# MinesweeperClone
A Minesweeper Clone written in C++ with Qt Framework

This minesweeper clone was originally created as a bonus points projects in my cs college class. There are different modes implemented from standards easy, intermediate and hard, to specials like confusion, where some numbers are reversed.
It also comes with a statistics feature that can track the amount of overall playtime, best times, wins, losses and the efficiency per mode.
